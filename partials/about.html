<div class="caption">I take pride in my personal work and I love nothing more than doing things right.</div>

<p>Coming from a musical family, inspiration has always been around me. I grew up around music and culture, and I developed an early love for art (by sitting in front of the TV, drawing my favorite cartoon characters).</p>

<p>My first computer opened a new world to me - after I broke it numerous times, I learned to exercise my creativity with new digital mediums. Armed with Notepad, Paint Shop Pro, and Internet Explorer 4, I began designing for the web. Eventually, I learned the ins and outs of computing, and pursued a career in it.</p>

<p>Today, I'm an autonomous individual who loves thinking about the possibilities that new technologies enable. Spending four years in an IT career has allowed me to broaden my horizons, cultivate new ideas, and discover new ways to implement them.</p>
